# jest-snapshots-svg

Take a React Native component tree, and render it into an SVG.

```ts
// _tests/render.test.tsx

import * as React from "react"
import { Text } from "react-native"
import * as renderer from "react-test-renderer"
import "jest-snapshots-svg"

describe("Fixtures", () => {
  it("does some simple JSX", () => {
    const component = renderer.create(<Text />).toJSON()
    expect(component).toMatchSnapshot()
    expect(component).toMatchSVGSnapshot(480, 640)
  })
})
```

Would make:

```sh
src/_tests/
├── __snapshots__
│   ├── render.test.tsx.snap
│   └── render.test.tsx-does-some-simple-jsx.svg
└── render.test.tsx
```

It does this by emulating the rendering process of React Native by calling yoga-layout directly in your tests, then converting the output of the layout-pass into SVG items that can easy be previewed in GitHub.

## What does this look like in principal?

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Your code</th>
    <th width="30%">The final SVG</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Write your normal Jest snapshot tests, but use <code>toMatchSVGSnapshot</code></p>

    import * as React from "react"
    import { View } from "react-native"
    import * as renderer from "react-test-renderer"
    import "jest-snapshots-svg"

    const squareStyle = (color) =>
      ({ width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: color })

    it("Renders three centered blocks", () => {
      const jsx =
        <View style={{

      const component = renderer.create(jsx).toJSON()
      expect(component).toMatchSVGSnapshot(320, 480)
    })

### Fonts

If you use `<Text />` elements, you must have access to the font files so we can lay the text out.
Usually, this just means having the font installed. However, if this goes wrong, this can be done
manually via the `loadFont` function, where you pass in the font file as a buffer.

```js
import { loadFont } from "jest-snapshots-svg"

loadFont(fs.readFileSync("your-font-file.ttf"))
```

This should be able to determine the `fontFamily`, `fontWeight`, and `fontStyle`. However, if it's
wrong, or it failed, you can pass these in as a second argument.

```js
loadFont(fs.readFileSync("your-font-file.ttf"), {
  fontFamily: "Helvetica",
  fontWeight: "normal",
  fontStyle: "normal"
})
```

If you have a `.ttc` file (a collection of multiple files), and it fails to correctly guess the font
style parameters, you can provide a `postscriptName` in the style object to target a specific font.
Do this in combination with passing in the font style arguments. See more about this over at
[fontkit](https://github.com/devongovett/fontkit#api).

### Flaws

This is definitely pre-1.0, we only have it working on a few tests in [artsy/emission](https://github.com/artsy/emission/). Expect alpha quality style snapshots for a while, but more people working on it will mean we all get a better chance at it working out well.

* Doesn't render image - see [#18](https://github.com/orta/jest-snapshots-svg/issues/18)
* Not all flexbox attributes are supported - see [#19](https://github.com/orta/jest-snapshots-svg/issues/19)

### I want to work on this

OK, you need to clone this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/orta/jest-snapshots-svg.git
```

There's the usual stuff, `yarn test` and `yarn lint`.

If you want to work against your own projects, then you need to set it up for linking and turn on watch mode.

```sh
yarn watch # starts a server, so make a new tab for the next bits
yarn link

cd [my_project]
yarn link jest-snapshot-svg
```

Now your project is using the dev version of this.

## TODO:

- **v0-0.5:** make it work
- **v0.5-1:** make it good
- **v1:** figure out how/if it should end up in jest
- **v2:** use iTerm to show the images inline
- **v3:** get vscode-jest to preview them inline
